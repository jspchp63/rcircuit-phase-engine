# START HERE — RCIRCUIT Evaluation Entry Point

Welcome.  
If you're a VC, researcher, or engineer evaluating Phase Computing,  
review these 3 files **in this exact order**:

1. **Phase_Compute_Architecture.md**  
   → Why GPUs fail: Heat, Power, Distance, Timing.  
     Why Phase > FLOPS.

2. **../src/phase_engine_core_v1.py**  
   → Minimal executable engine (Δ-signal → coherence → propagation loop).

3. **v1.0_integration_skeleton.md**  
   → How the full architecture fits together (Phase OS + Engine + Pipeline).

If these three make sense to you, continue.  
If not, you are not the intended audience.
