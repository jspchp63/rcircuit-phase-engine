Experiment 05 — Phase Field Visualization (v0.5)

Goal:
Observe how local-only updates evolve global phase patterns without any transport.

Procedure:
1. Initialize PhaseEngine(size=60, alpha=0.12, gamma=0.20)
2. Run for 300 steps
3. Save snapshots every 20 steps
4. Plot phase fields as heatmaps

Expected Outcome:
• coherence zones will emerge
• no value transport occurs
• phase evolution organizes spatial structures

Code:
python visualize_phase_field.py
