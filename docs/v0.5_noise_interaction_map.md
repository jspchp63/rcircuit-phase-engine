# RCIRCUIT v0.5 — Noise Interaction Map (Research Skeleton)

This document defines the skeleton for the **Noise Interaction Map**,  
a diagnostic layer describing how random fluctuations interact with phase 
propagation inside RCIRCUIT nodes.

This is not a full model — only the structural framework for researchers.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Noise Interaction Map
Conventional compute systems treat noise as an error.  
RCIRCUIT treats noise as a **phase modifier** that can either:

- destabilize coherence  
- reinforce resonance  
- trigger collapse boundaries  
- create new interaction zones  

This document defines the minimum structure required to map those effects.

## 2. Minimal Data Schema (Skeleton Only)

NodeID
Phase(t)
DeltaSignal(t)
Noise(t)
NoiseType {thermal, jitter, cross-talk, synthetic}
NoiseAmplitude
NoiseFrequency
PhaseResponse(t)
ResonanceShift(t)
CollapseProbability(t)


Descriptions:

- **Noise(t)** — instantaneous perturbation  
- **NoiseType** — category influencing frequency domain  
- **NoiseAmplitude** — strength of interference  
- **NoiseFrequency** — oscillation characteristics  
- **PhaseResponse(t)** — how phase reacts to noise at time t  
- **ResonanceShift(t)** — deviation from coherence trajectory  
- **CollapseProbability(t)** — likelihood of decoherence

## 3. Core Interaction Rules (Not implemented)

1. **Amplitude Coupling Rule**  
   High-amplitude noise increases phase deviation linearly → until threshold.

2. **Frequency Coupling Rule**  
   Noise frequencies close to phase frequency cause resonance shift.

3. **Cross-talk Injection Rule**  
   Reinforcing noise can *increase* coherence under certain Δsignal conditions.

4. **Collapse Trigger Rule**  
   If (NoiseAmplitude × NoiseFrequency) > stability_limit → collapse event.

5. **Noise Diffusion Rule** (placeholder)  
   Noise propagates to neighbor nodes with decay and delay.

## 4. Planned Visualizations
v0.5 diagrams (to be implemented in later versions):

- Noise vs Phase deviation curves  
- Collapse boundary surface  
- Resonance shift vector field  
- Noise-type heatmaps (thermal / jitter / cross-talk)  
- Δsignal × Noise × Response 3D plots  

These help identify whether phase compute outperforms FLOPS under 
interconnect-induced noise conditions.

## 5. Future Components (v0.5 → v0.6)
- noise_interaction_core.py (prototype)
- collapse_boundary_estimator.py
- noise_resonance_visualizer tools
- hooks for rcircuit_core_v0.2 & stability_map_v0.4

---

## 6. Research Notes
This skeleton enables early academic inspection without releasing:

- stability equations  
- resonance thresholds  
- noise coupling coefficients  
- collapse-prediction models  

Full release requires safety, IP, and partner verification.

## Version Status
- **Public-safe release:** v0.5 Noise Interaction Map Skeleton  
- **Full model:** private (internal)  

Noise is not an error.  
Noise is a phase force.
