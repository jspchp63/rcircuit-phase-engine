# RCIRCUIT v0.6 — Resonance Threshold Estimator (Research Skeleton)

This document defines the structural skeleton for the **Resonance Threshold Estimator**,  
a diagnostic module that identifies when a phase node transitions between:

• Stable coherence  
• Semi-stable drift  
• Pre-collapse oscillation  
• Full decoherence  

The goal is NOT to compute final values — only to define the interface, variables,
and expected behaviors for future RCIRCUIT releases.

---

## 1. Purpose
The Resonance Threshold Estimator measures **how close a node is to losing coherence**  
based on Δsignal patterns, noise interaction (v0.5), and phase drift rate.

It answers one question:

**“Is this node approaching collapse?”**

---

## 2. Minimal Variable Set (Skeleton Only)

NodeID
Phase(t)
DeltaSignal(t)
DriftRate(t)
ResonanceScore(t)
NoiseAmplitude(t)
NoiseFrequency(t)
CoherenceLevel(t)
ThresholdEstimate(t)
CollapseRisk(t)
StateClass {stable, drift, pre-collapse, collapse}

Descriptions:

- **DriftRate(t)** — rate of phase deviation over time  
- **ResonanceScore(t)** — stability indicator derived from Δsignal patterns  
- **CoherenceLevel(t)** — normalized metric (0–1)  
- **ThresholdEstimate(t)** — predicted distance from collapse boundary  
- **CollapseRisk(t)** — probabilistic output  
- **StateClass** — discrete diagnostic label

## 3. Core Rules (Not implemented — conceptual)

1. **Drift Accumulation Rule**  
   If DriftRate(t) increases over time → stability decreases.

2. **Resonance Score Rule**  
   High Δsignal consistency → increases coherence level.

3. **Noise Interaction Rule**  
   Inherits from v0.5 (Noise Interaction Map).  
   Noise influences drift and coherence simultaneously.

4. **Threshold Prediction Rule**  
   ThresholdEstimate(t) is derived from:  
f(DriftRate, NoiseAmplitude, NoiseFrequency, Δsignal variability)

5. **Collapse Classification Rule**  
If ThresholdEstimate(t) < critical_margin → StateClass = pre-collapse.

---

## 4. Expected Output Format
The estimator should eventually produce:

NodeID: 12
threshold: 0.14
collapse_risk: 0.78
state: "pre-collapse"
drift_rate: 0.032
coherence_level: 0.41
notes: “instability rising; noise-frequency coupling detected”


This is NOT implemented here — only the structure.

---

## 5. Planned Visualizations
Future (v0.6 → v0.7) visual output:

- DriftRate vs Threshold curve  
- Collapse boundary approximation  
- NoiseAmplitude × DriftRate heatmap  
- ResonanceScore trajectory plots  
- StateClass timeline per node  

These visuals anchor RCIRCUIT as a compute-physics-driven architecture.

---

## 6. Roadmap Integration
v0.6 feeds into:

- v0.7 Collapse Boundary Estimator  
- v0.8 Multi-node Resonance Field Map  
- v1.0 RCIRCUIT Stability Engine (public-safe subset)

---

## 7. Research Notes
This skeleton enables academic review of the upcoming safety-critical components.  
Full models will NOT be released until:

- safety evaluation  
- IP clearance  
- partner verification  

Early exposure creates trust and signals transparency to deep-tech researchers.

---

## Version Status
- **Public-safe research skeleton:** v0.6  
- **Full estimator:** private (internal)

Stability isn’t a constant.  
It is a distance — to collapse.
