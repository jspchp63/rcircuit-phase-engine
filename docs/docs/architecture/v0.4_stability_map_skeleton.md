# RCIRCUIT v0.4 — Stability Map Skeleton (Research Draft)

This document outlines the minimal skeleton for the **Phase Stability Map**,  
a core diagnostic tool used to evaluate coherence, noise tolerance, and phase 
survivability inside RCIRCUIT nodes.

This is *not* a full release — only the structural blueprint researchers need 
to understand what comes next.

## 1. Purpose of the Stability Map
RCIRCUIT shifts compute from value-based operations to **phase propagation**.  
To make phase-based compute reliable, we must measure:

- local phase stability  
- Δsignal volatility  
- resonance threshold crossing  
- decoherence probability  
- noise–phase interaction zones  

These measurements form a *Stability Map* — a 2D/3D representation of how 
phase behaves under stress.

## 2. Minimal Data Model (Skeleton Only)

NodeID
Phase(t)
DeltaSignal(t)
LocalCoherence(t)
NoiseLevel(t)
ResonanceScore(t)
StabilityClass {A,B,C,D,F}


Description:

- **Phase(t)** — instantaneous phase value  
- **Δsignal(t)** — meaningful change extracted from input  
- **LocalCoherence(t)** — short-range alignment metric  
- **NoiseLevel(t)** — random perturbation affecting stability  
- **ResonanceScore(t)** — internal RCIRCUIT scoring function  
- **StabilityClass** — discrete classification for engineering use

## 3. Stability Rules (Not yet implemented)

The following rules guide future implementation:

1. **Coherence Rise Rule**  
   If Δsignal reinforces phase direction → Coherence increases.

2. **Decoherence Rule**  
   If noise > coherence threshold → Phase collapses locally.

3. **Resonance Peak Rule**  
   If resonance score crosses R\_critical → Node stabilizes.

4. **Propagation Dampening**  
   Unstable nodes transmit reduced Δsignal.

5. **Cross-node Influence** (placeholder)  
   Stability field spreads to neighbors with decay factor.

---

## 4. Visualization Plan (Skeleton)
Future versions will generate:

- Stability heatmaps (Phase vs Noise)
- Resonance trajectory plots
- Δsignal → Stability response curves
- Collapse boundary diagrams

These visual tools will allow HPC and interconnect researchers to evaluate 
phase survivability under GPU-equivalent load conditions.

## 5. Planned Outputs for v0.4 → v0.5
- stability_map_core.py (prototype)
- resonance_threshold_estimator.py
- noise_field_simulator.py
- 2D/3D plotting utilities
- integration hooks for rcircuit_core_v0.2

## 6. Notes for Researchers
This skeleton is intentionally minimal.  
Purpose: allow early evaluation of the conceptual structure while protecting 
full implementation for safety, IP, and partner review.

If you understand why **phase stability** is the real bottleneck,  
you are already in the right field.

## Version Status
- **Public-safe release:** v0.4-skeleton  
- **Full model:** private (pending partner & legal review)

Physics breaks FLOPS.  
Stability enables PHASE.
