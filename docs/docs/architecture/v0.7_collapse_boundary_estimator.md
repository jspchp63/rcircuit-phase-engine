# RCIRCUIT v0.7 — Collapse Boundary Estimator (Research Skeleton)

This document provides the structural skeleton for the **Collapse Boundary Estimator**,  
a module that defines and predicts the boundary at which a phase node transitions  
from unstable drift → pre-collapse → full collapse.

v0.6 estimated proximity to collapse.  
v0.7 defines the **boundary itself**.

This is a research skeleton — no equations, only structure and logic.

---

## 1. Purpose
The Collapse Boundary Estimator approximates a **critical surface**:

> “At what combination of drift, noise, Δsignal variability, and coherence  
> does a node *guarantee* collapse?”

This boundary is not a single value.  
It is a **multidimensional manifold** that depends on several interacting variables.

## 2. Boundary Variable Set (Skeleton)

NodeID
Phase(t)
DeltaSignal(t)
DriftRate(t)
NoiseAmplitude(t)
NoiseFrequency(t)
CoherenceLevel(t)
InstabilityIndex(t)
CriticalSurfaceEstimate(t)
BoundaryMargin(t)
CollapseState {stable, drift, pre-collapse, collapse}


Descriptions:

- **InstabilityIndex(t)** — combined measure from v0.5 & v0.6  
- **CriticalSurfaceEstimate(t)** — predicted collapse boundary value  
- **BoundaryMargin(t)** — distance from critical surface (signed)  
- **CollapseState** — classification relative to boundary  

---

## 3. Core Conceptual Rules

### Rule 1 — Boundary Formation
Collapse occurs when:

InstabilityIndex(t) > CriticalSurfaceEstimate(t)



Where InstabilityIndex(t) is a weighted combination of:

DriftRate
Δsignal variability
Noise amplitude × noise frequency
Coherence decay



(No numerical weights defined — skeleton only)

---

### Rule 2 — Boundary Margin
BoundaryMargin(t) = CriticalSurfaceEstimate(t) - InstabilityIndex(t)

Interpretation:

- Positive → stable  
- Near zero → pre-collapse  
- Negative → collapse  

---

### Rule 3 — Boundary Sensitivity
The boundary is more sensitive to:

- high-frequency noise  
- rapid phase drift  
- irregular Δsignal patterns  
- coherence collapse rate  

These variables distort the critical surface.

---

### Rule 4 — Phase-space Modeling
Boundary must be computed in **phase-space**, not time-space:

(phase, drift_rate, noise, Δsignal_variability)



Time is a parameter, not the axis.

## 4. Expected Diagnostic Output

NodeID: 7
critical_surface: 0.62
instability_index: 0.71
boundary_margin: -0.09
collapse_state: "collapse"
notes: “node exceeded boundary; noise-drift coupling detected”


---

## 5. Planned Visualizations (v0.7 → v0.8 → v1.0)

- Critical surface 3D plot  
- Boundary margin time-series  
- Instability-index vs boundary cross-sections  
- Noise-frequency distortion lens  
- Collapse-region heatmaps  

These visualizations will define the RCIRCUIT research identity.

---

## 6. Integration Roadmap
v0.7 connects directly into:

- v0.8 Multi-node Resonance Field Map  
- v0.9 Stability Engine Pre-release  
- v1.0 Collapse Dynamics & Recovery Model  

This is where phase computing becomes a **spatial physics** architecture.

---

## 7. Research Notes
The boundary estimator is safety-critical  
and will not be implemented publicly until:

- coherence safety review  
- compute-physics partner review  
- IP lock  
- collapse-recovery model verification  

---

## Version Status
- **Public-safe research skeleton:** v0.7  
- **Full estimator:** private (internal)

A system collapses  
not when it loses energy —  
but when it crosses a boundary it cannot feel.
