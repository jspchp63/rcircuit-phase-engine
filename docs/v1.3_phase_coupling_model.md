# RCIRCUIT v1.3 — Phase Coupling Model (Skeleton)

## Purpose
Define how **two or more phase nodes influence each other**,  
creating local coherence or divergence.

This is the minimal public-safe coupling rule.

---

## 1. Node States
Each node has:
- `phase`
- `delta_signal`
- `coupling_weight` (0.0 → 1.0)

---

## 2. Pairwise Coupling Rule
Two nodes A and B interact:

coupled_delta = coupling_weight * (phase_B - phase_A)


Interpretation:
- If B > A → A is “pulled upward”
- If A > B → A is “pulled downward”

This imitates physical phase attraction without real energy transfer.

---

## 3. Updated Phase
phase_A_new = phase_A + coupled_delta
phase_B_new = phase_B - coupled_delta


This keeps the local system mass-neutral.

---

## 4. Stability Check
if abs(coupled_delta) < threshold:
coupling_state = "STABLE"
else:
coupling_state = "UNSTABLE"


Threshold default (public):
threshold = 0.05


---

## 5. Multi-Node Coupling (Minimal Rule)
For N nodes:

for each node i:
phase_i_new = phase_i + Σ(coupling_weight * (phase_j - phase_i))


Only local neighbors (adjacent indices) are allowed in v1.3.

---

## 6. Meaning
- Coupling models **how coherence spreads** in a phase network.  
- This is the foundation of:
  - v1.4 Local Coherence Map  
  - v1.5 Resonance Field Accumulator  
  - v2.x Phase Routing  

---

## 7. Notes
This version is intentionally under-specified.  
Full coupling dynamics (non-linear / chaos-prevention / harmonic lock)  
will be released in v2.x.
