# RCIRCUIT v1.6 — Global Propagation Gate (Skeleton)

## Purpose
Define the minimal public-safe rule for when **local phase coherence** is allowed to propagate globally.

GPUs synchronize globally every cycle → heavy cost.  
RCIRCUIT only propagates when the field is *stable enough*.

---

## 1. Inputs
From previous modules:
- `R_field` (v1.5 accumulator result)
- `mean_phase`
- `coherence_global`

---

## 2. Global Gate Equation (minimal)

The gate opens only when:

Gate = (R_field >= propagation_threshold) AND (coherence_global >= global_consistency)


Default parameters:
propagation_threshold = 0.50
global_consistency = 0.70


Interpretation:
- System must have enough **resonance energy**
- And enough **global coherence** across local windows

---

## 3. Propagation Rule

If gate opens:

phase_global = mean_phase + R_field * propagation_gain


Default:
propagation_gain = 0.1


If gate does **not** open:

phase_global = mean_phase (no propagation)


---

## 4. Why This Works
GPU model:
- global sync → expensive
- no coherence notion → waste energy, timing collapse

RCIRCUIT model:
- propagate *only when stable*
- resonance-driven sync instead of forced sync
- lower interconnect load
- avoids jitter & collapse

---

## 5. Failure Modes Prevented
The propagation gate prevents:
- timing cascade failures
- unstable phase amplification
- destructive interference
- heat spikes from unnecessary sync

---

## 6. Private Layer (not disclosed)
Full implementation includes:
- predictive global harmonics  
- adaptive gating  
- cross-window coherence tension graph  

These are omitted for safety/IP reasons.
