# RCIRCUIT v1.5 — Resonance Field Accumulator (Skeleton)

## Purpose
Define how RCIRCUIT forms a **resonance field** from local coherence values.

GPUs accumulate FLOPS.  
RCIRCUIT accumulates **resonant energy** from stable phase clusters.

---

## 1. Inputs
For each local cluster window W:
- `coherence(W)`  ∈ [0, 1]
- `mean_phase(W)`
- `delta_signal(W)`

---

## 2. Resonance Energy (minimal public-safe formula)

R_energy = coherence(W) * abs(mean_phase(W)) * gain


Default:
gain = 0.1


Interpretation:
- coherence ↑ → energy ↑  
- strong phase alignment creates stronger resonance fields

---

## 3. Accumulator Rule (v1.5 minimal)

R_field = Σ (R_energy of stable clusters)


Only clusters where:
coherence(W) >= stability_threshold

contribute to the field.

Default threshold:
stability_threshold = 0.85

---

## 4. Output Zones (public-safe)

The accumulated field is categorized:

R_field < 0.2 → LOW resonance
0.2 ≤ R_field < 0.5 → MID resonance
R_field ≥ 0.5 → HIGH resonance


HIGH resonance implies:
- global propagation possible
- stable update path
- low interconnect load

---

## 5. Why It Matters
GPUs have **no concept of resonance accumulation**.  
They brute-force compute.

RCIRCUIT:
- builds resonance locally  
- accumulates stability energy  
- propagates only when safe/stable  
→ reducing heat, timing jitter, and data movement.

## 6. Private Notes (not included in public algorithm)
Full v2.x accumulator includes:
- harmonic suppression  
- destructive phase cancellation  
- predictive stabilization  
This is redacted for safety/IP.
