# RCIRCUIT v1.9 — Resonant Compute Pulse (Execution Skeleton)

## Purpose
The Resonant Compute Pulse (RCP) defines how RCIRCUIT executes computation by emitting
**phase-based pulses**, instead of value-based operations.

FLOPS = value movement  
RCP  = resonance emission  

This document provides the minimal public skeleton of the RCP model.

## 1. Pulse Definition

A pulse is defined as:

pulse = {
amplitude: Δsignal,
carrier_phase: phase_i,
coherence_gate: coherence_local_i,
decay_rate: default 0.92,
}

A pulse is generated ONLY IF:

coherence_local_i >= emission_threshold
emission_threshold = 0.35

---

## 2. Pulse Emission Rule

pulse_out = amplitude * carrier_phase * coherence_gate


Interpretation:
- amplitude = semantic change  
- carrier_phase = local wave state  
- coherence_gate = local stability check  

If pulse_out < stability_minimum → **pulse is suppressed**.

Default:
stability_minimum = 0.01

---

## 3. Pulse Propagation

Pulse is propagated to neighbors:

pulse_j = pulse_out * edge_weight[i → j]


Propagation allowed only when:

|phase_i - phase_j| <= propagation_threshold


---

## 4. Pulse Merge Rule (Critical)

If two pulses arrive at node j:

pulse_merge = Σ pulse_k * sign(phase_alignment_k)


Where:

phase_alignment_k = 1 if aligned
phase_alignment_k = -1 if destructive (near π)


To avoid blow-up:

if |pulse_merge| > merge_limit:
pulse_merge = sign(pulse_merge) * merge_limit


Default:
merge_limit = 0.50


---

## 5. Compute Interpretation

In RCIRCUIT:

Computation = pulse interactions + phase updates + coherence adjustments


This replaces:
- matrix multiply  
- tensor contraction  
- FLOPS-driven operations  

with **wave interference patterns that encode meaning, salience, and direction of change**.

---

## 6. Stability Conditions

The RCP engine refuses to emit pulses if:

- coherence is collapsing  
- global R-density < minimum_resonance  
- local destructive interference detected  
- pulse accumulation exceeds node capacity  

Defaults:
minimum_resonance = 0.15
node_capacity = 0.75

---

## 7. What RCP Solves

### GPU Execution
- 비용: value movement  
- 병목: interconnect  
- 부작용: pipeline stall, cache miss, thermal choke  

### RCIRCUIT Execution
- 비용: wave alignment  
- 병목 없음: no global value traffic  
- 성능: parallel resonance execution  
- 안정성: coherence-gated pulses
