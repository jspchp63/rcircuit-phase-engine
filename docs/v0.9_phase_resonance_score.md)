# RCIRCUIT v0.9 — Phase Stability Threshold Detector (Skeleton)

This document defines the minimal structure for detecting the point where
phase propagation becomes unstable under accumulated Δsignal interactions.

## 1. Purpose
Identify the **stability → instability transition boundary** by tracking:
- phase variance
- Δsignal accumulation rate
- coherence drift
- noise interference sensitivity

This threshold is required for future v1.0 stability guarantees.

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### (1) Stability Metric (S)
A simple placeholder formula:

S = 1 / (1 + |phase_variance| + noise_gain)


When **S < threshold**, RCIRCUIT enters instability.

---

### (2) Drift Accumulator (D)
Tracks slow, invisible divergence in phase alignment.

D = Σ (Δsignal * local_susceptibility)


Large **D** indicates a pre-collapse state.

---

### (3) Coherence Loss Point (CLP)
A single number where local phase nodes no longer align.

CLP = variance(phase_neighbors)


Higher CLP → lower global stability.

---

## 3. Minimal Algorithm Skeleton

initialize phase_nodes
initialize stability_threshold = 0.75

for each timestep:
compute phase_variance
compute noise_gain
compute S = 1 / (1 + |phase_variance| + noise_gain)

compute D = drift_accumulator_update()
compute CLP = coherence_loss(phase_nodes)

if S < stability_threshold:
    flag("early instability")

if CLP > limit:
    flag("collapse imminent")

log(S, D, CLP)


This is NOT the final algorithm — it is only a **v0.9 conceptual outline**.

---

## 4. Output (Placeholder)

S(t): 0.92 → 0.88 → 0.81 → 0.76 → 0.69 (unstable)
D(t): 0.01 → 0.03 → 0.09 → 0.12 → 0.20
CLP(t): 0.002 → 0.008 → 0.014 → 0.030 → 0.055

## 5. Notes
- Actual formulas will evolve in v1.0.
- This skeleton is meant to communicate **intent + architecture**, not implementation.
- Safe for public release.

---
**Next:** v1.0 Integration Skeleton (only after v0.9 merges cleanly).
