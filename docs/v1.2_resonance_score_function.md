# RCIRCUIT v1.2 — Resonance Score Function (Skeleton)

## Purpose
Define a minimal public-safe formula for **resonance_score**,  
the core metric that measures coherence quality in phase computing.

---

## 1. Inputs
- `phase_old`
- `phase_new`
- `delta_signal`
- `stability_flag` (STABLE / UNSTABLE)

---

## 2. Δphase
delta_phase = abs(phase_new - phase_old)


Small = coherent  
Large = unstable

---

## 3. Base Score (Minimal Public Rule)
base_score = 1 / (1 + delta_phase)


- Approaches **1.0** when stable  
- Approaches **0.0** when unstable  

---

## 4. Stability Modifier
if stability_flag == STABLE:
modifier = 1.0
else:
modifier = 0.5


---

## 5. Final Resonance Score
resonance_score = base_score * modifier


This is intentionally simple.  
Advanced non-linear scoring (hyperbolic decay / phase variance models)  
will be released in v2.x.

---

## 6. Interpretation
- Resonance score represents **local coherence**.  
- High score = node remains stable across Δsignal.  
- Low score = node enters instability region.  
- This is the **core metric** for future RCIRCUIT OS scheduling & routing.

## 7. Next Steps
v1.3 → Phase Coupling Model  
v1.4 → Local Coherence Map  
v1.5 → Resonance Field Accumulator
