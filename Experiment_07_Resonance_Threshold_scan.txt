Experiment 07 — Resonance Threshold Scan (Compute_E Check)

Goal:
Test how Δ-phase interactions transition across threshold levels.

Procedure:
• Vary coupling strength γ from 0.05 to 0.5
• Compute Δφ and detect activation
• Record activation boundary

Expected output:
• Threshold boundary curve
• Shows Compute_E proportionality trend
