Experiment 06 — Coherence Decay Curve

Goal:
Measure how coherence C decays with radius r in a local-update compute engine.

Procedure:
1. Initialize engine
2. Introduce a local impulse at center
3. Measure correlation with distance r
4. Fit exponential decay: C(r) = exp(-λr)

Deliverable:
Graph: coherence vs distance
