Experiment 05 — Coupling Sweep (γ Scan)
Goal:
Evaluate how coupling strength γ affects stability, drift, and resonance amplification.

Procedure:
1. Initialize a 20×20 or 50×50 grid
2. Sweep γ across [0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8]
3. Run 100–300 phase update steps
4. Measure:
   - local drift
   - resonance overshoot
   - coherence half-life
   - transition events

Expected Behavior:
- Low γ → under-coupled, stable but inactive
- Optimal γ → distinct logical transitions form
- High γ → oscillation or chaotic divergence

Interpretation:
Coupling sweep defines the "usable window" of RCIRCUIT,
similar to finding a stable operating voltage in analog circuits.
