RCIRCUIT v2.1 — Whitepaper (Safe TXT Edition)
Phase Evolution as a Transport-Free Compute Paradigm
Author: Chulhee Park
Version: 2.1

ABSTRACT
Modern AI systems are collapsing under physical limits not from arithmetic but from transport.
HBM saturation, wire delay, interconnect congestion, and thermal jitter dominate compute behavior.

RCIRCUIT proposes a transport-free compute model where values never move and only local phase-state evolution performs computation.

This edition includes:

Compute_E Law

Phase OS integration

Scaling model

PoC example

Roadmap to universality

INTRODUCTION — TRANSPORT COLLAPSE
Modern accelerators fail due to movement, not math.

Transport dominates:

HBM bandwidth ceilings

global memory stalls

wire delay

thermal jitter

synchronization overhead

Transport scales O(N^2); compute scales O(N).
RCIRCUIT shifts computation from moving values → evolving states.

LIMITATIONS OF MATMUL COMPUTE
Tensor operations require fetch, multiply, accumulate, reshape, and redistribute.
Every step requires movement.

Transport is 30–200× more expensive than ALU compute.
Thus modern AI is transport-bound, not compute-bound.

RCIRCUIT OVERVIEW
RCIRCUIT eliminates global transport:

no tensors

no global memory

no long-distance propagation

no synchronization

Computation emerges from local phase-state evolution.

MINIMAL ARCHITECTURE

RC Cell Structure:
phase
delta
coupling

Update Rule:
delta_i(t+1) = γ Σ_j (phase_j - phase_i)
phase_i(t+1) = phase_i(t) + α * delta_i(t+1)

PDE Interpretation:
∂φ/∂t = α ∇²φ + γ R(φ)

COMPUTE_E LAW (v2.1)

Compute_E = (Phase Amplitude × Coupling Strength) / Propagation Time

Phase amplitude = energy differential
Coupling strength = interaction strength
Propagation time = update latency

BENCHMARK MODEL

Transport Cost:

Memory Move (HBM): 100

Multiply: 1

Local Phase Step: 0.1

Scaling:
MatMul: T(N) = O(N^2)
RCIRCUIT: T(N) = O(N)

LOGICAL EXPRESSIVENESS

XOR Operation:
Δφ = |φ1 - φ2|
XOR = 1 if Δφ > θ

Roadmap:
XOR
NOT
AND
NAND (universality)

COHERENCE & STABILITY

Local Drift:
φ_i(t+1) = φ_i(t) + ε

Coherence Decay:
C(r) = exp(-λ r)

Errors remain local, not global.

PHASE OS INTEGRATION

Phase OS schedules:

local update windows

resonance alignment

coherence thresholds

stability-driven activation

Phase OS is the first OS designed for state evolution, not value movement.

POC (EXPERIMENT)

Run:
python src/phase_xor_poc_v01.py

Example Output:
φ1 = -0.134, φ2 = -0.722 → XOR = 1
φ1 = -0.406, φ2 = -0.491 → XOR = 0

CONCLUSION

Transport is collapsing under physical limits.
Movement is too expensive.

RCIRCUIT provides:

transport-free compute model

coherent scaling law

pathway to post-MatMul architectures

Stop moving values.
Start evolving states.
