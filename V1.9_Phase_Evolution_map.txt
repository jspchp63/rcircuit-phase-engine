v1.9 — Phase Evolution Map (Text Edition)

State Regions:
1. Low-drift region (stable)
2. Linear-propagation region (useful for logic)
3. Resonant-amplification region (XOR, AND activity)
4. Coherence-collapse region (unstable)

A phase trajectory φ(t) transitions through these regions depending on:
- α (propagation)
- γ (coupling)
- noise ε

This map provides a guide for identifying where computation reliably emerges
without visualization assets.
