RCIRCUIT Roadmap v1.0

Phase Evolution Compute Model — From Concept to Engine

Stage 0 — Concept Foundation (완료)

Initial theoretical base that establishes RCIRCUIT as a post-transport compute direction.

Transport-Free Compute concept

Compute_E formulation

PDE-style phase evolution model

Post-MatMul motivation

Status: ✔ DONE

Stage 1 — Phase Engine v0.x (완료)

Minimal executable engine demonstrating transport-free logic.

Implemented:

Local update kernel

Phase node structure

Coupling model

XOR PoC

Stability & coherence behavior (v0.5)

Experiments 01–08

Status: ✔ DONE

Stage 2 — Phase Engine v0.6 (진행 중)

Goal: strengthen physical realism + coherence quality.

Includes:

Coherence evolution and decay

Drift/noise behavior

Threshold event detection

Logic primitive plan: AND → NAND

Phase state snapshots

Status: ● 70%

Stage 3 — Research Pack v1.0 (현재 문서)

This roadmap document completes the researcher onboarding layer.

It provides:

Motivation & transport-collapse physics

PDE core

Engine summary

Experiment summary

Universality roadmap

Phase OS mini-map

Commercial & infrastructure relevance

Next milestones

This document is the entry point for labs, HPC groups, and accelerator teams evaluating RCIRCUIT.

Status: ✔ READY FOR UPLOAD

Stage 4 — Collaboration Layer (v1.x)

After v1.0, RCIRCUIT becomes “lab-ready.”

Expected outcomes:

3–5 academic papers possible

Grant funding likely

PoC replication & extension by researchers

Potential onboarding with KAIST / MIT / NVIDIA / Stanford

Status: △ Pending external engagement

Stage 5 — Phase Engine v1.0 

Full-featured transport-free compute engine.

Targets:

Universal gate set (XOR, NOT, AND, NAND)

HPC-grade simulation

Visualization layer (assets/ directory)

On-device phase compute prototype (experimental)

Status: Future, requires team / funding

Purpose of This Roadmap

Researchers require:

A top-level map

A clear progress line

A collaboration entry point

This file answers all three.

Upload it, and RCIRCUIT becomes:

a structured research domain

not a random repo

but a compute direction with a plan
