# RCIRCUIT Phase Engine

⚠ For full project vision (HROS / Phase OS / Interconnect Research), see:
https://github.com/jspchp63/HROS-RCIRCUIT-LAB
This repository focuses only on the RCIRCUIT Phase Engine (core model).

---

## 0. Research Summary

RCIRCUIT models how **energy and affect** transition into **structured meaning** before language-level reasoning.
The core loop:

**Feel → Think → Resonance → Return**

This loop reduces noise, stabilizes phase, and produces a machine-readable “resonant state”.

---

## 1. Scope of This Repository

This repository focuses **only** on:

- the minimal RCIRCUIT phase engine (Δsignal loop)
- sub-semantic processing
- local coherence and phase stabilization
- simple experiments for noise → resonance transition

It does **not** include:

- HROS
- GPU replacement
- full Phase Compute OS
- philosophical models

Those belong to separate projects.

## 3. Minimal RCIRCUIT Loop

1. **Feel** — non-linear encoding  
2. **Think** — aggregation  
3. **Resonance** — pattern stabilization  
4. **Return** — state integration  

For input `s`:

f1 = Feel(s)
f2 = Think(f1)
f3 = Resonance(f2)
out = Return(f3)

A minimal Python implementation will appear in `src/rcircuit_core.py`.

## 4. Intended Audience

- cognitive architecture researchers
- affective computing researchers
- signal/phase processing engineers
- those exploring phase-based computation

---

## 5. Status

Research-stage, intentionally minimal.

- Concept loop defined  
- Minimal implementation pending  
- Experiments will be added gradually  
- No production code included
