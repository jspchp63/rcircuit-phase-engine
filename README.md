## 🚀 What is Phase Computing?

Modern AI systems do not fail because of mathematics.  
They fail because of **physics**:

- HBM saturation  
- Interconnect latency  
- Global synchronization pressure  
- Coherence collapse  

Phase Computing introduces a new paradigm:

> **Values never move.  
> Local phase evolution *is* computation.**

Transport disappears.  
Local resonance becomes the compute substrate.

This redefines the fundamental cost model of computation.

# 📊 Noise vs Coherence Map

A core physical signature of RCIRCUIT is the relationship:

> **Noise ↑ → Coherence ↓**

This reflects phase-driven stability collapse in transport-free compute regimes.
