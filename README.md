# PHASE COMPUTING ENGINE — RCIRCUIT  
### **Transport-Free Compute Architecture**  
### **Invented by Chulhee Park**

## 🚀 What is Phase Computing?

Modern AI systems no longer fail because of math —  
they fail because of **physics constraints**:

- HBM saturation  
- Interconnect latency  
- Global synchronization pressure  
- Coherence collapse  

Phase Computing introduces a new compute paradigm:

> **Values never move.  
> Local phase evolution *is* computation.**

No tensor transport.  
No global sync.  
Local resonance becomes the compute substrate.

## 📊 Example Plot: Noise vs Coherence

This plot shows how coherence collapses as noise increases —  
a fundamental signature of phase-compute physical systems.
