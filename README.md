PHASE COMPUTING ENGINE — RCIRCUIT
Transport-Free Compute Architecture
Invented by Chulhee Park
🚀 What is Phase Computing?

Modern AI systems are no longer limited by math.
They fail because of physics constraints:

HBM saturation

Interconnect latency

Global synchronization pressure

Coherence collapse

Phase Computing introduces a new compute paradigm:

Values never move.
Local phase evolution is computation.

No tensor transport.
No global sync.
Compute emerges from local resonance dynamics.

📊 Example Plot: Noise vs Coherence

This plot demonstrates how coherence collapses as noise increases —
a key signature of physical phase-compute systems.
