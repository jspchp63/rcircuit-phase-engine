## 🚀 What is Phase Computing?

Modern AI systems do not fail because of mathematics.  
They fail because of **physics**:

- HBM saturation  
- Interconnect latency  
- Global synchronization pressure  
- Coherence collapse  

Phase Computing introduces a new paradigm:

> **Values never move.  
> Local phase evolution *is* computation.**

Transport disappears.  
Local resonance becomes the compute substrate.  
This redefines the fundamental cost model of computation.

## 🧩 Background Philosophy — HROS → Phase Computing

R CIRCUIT originates from **HROS (Human Resonance Operating System)** —  
a framework where cognition is modeled as resonance:

- **Emotion = Energy × Meaning / Time**  
- **PPL (Pathos-Precedes-Logos): emotion forms structure before logic**  
- **IF-TERR Rule: coherence emerges only when emotional, logical and resonant layers align**  
- **Sub-semantic layer:** meaning behaves as *waves*, not tokens  
- **Feel-Wave Physics:** cognition as a physical resonance process  

Transport-dependent architectures (e.g., Transformers) collapse coherence  
under long context due to excessive movement.

To preserve coherence without transport,  
a new compute paradigm was required.

This foundation led directly to:

> **Phase Computing — computation emerging from local phase evolution,  
> instead of value transport.**

R CIRCUIT is the first practical implementation of this model.
