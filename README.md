# RCIRCUIT — Phase Computing Engine
### Post-MatMul / Post-FLOPS Compute Direction

**What if compute no longer depended on moving values?**

Modern AI is built on a value-transport paradigm:
move tensors → multiply → accumulate → move again.

This paradigm is now breaking under physics:

- HBM bandwidth saturates before FLOPS do  
- Interconnect latency dominates end-to-end time  
- Wire delay grows superlinearly with array size  
- Thermal jitter disrupts long-distance coherence  
- GPUs/TPUs stall waiting for data, not math  

The bottleneck is not compute —  
**it's movement.**

RCIRCUIT explores a transport-independent direction:
compute emerging from **local phase-state evolution**
instead of long-distance value movement.

Transport → expensive  
Local evolution → scalable

## 1. Why This Exists — Transport Collapse Physics
MatMul scaling fails not from arithmetic limits,
but from **movement limits**.

As models grow:

- memory traffic dominates  
- synchronization cost explodes  
- thermal noise accumulates  
- power consumption becomes unsustainable  

RCIRCUIT removes global data movement
and replaces it with **purely local phase updates**.

## 2. Compute Primitive Shift

**MatMul = value transport**  
data must move → high energy, long wires, global sync

**RCIRCUIT = phase propagation**  
state evolves locally → low transport, low sync

| Property        | MatMul            | RCIRCUIT              |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Compute unit   | tensor multiply   | phase evolution        |
| Movement       | global            | local                  |
| Scaling limit  | bandwidth         | locality               |
| Sync           | global            | none                   |
| Heat           | accumulated       | localized              |
| Complexity     | O(N²) transport   | O(N) local updates     |

Value moves → expensive  
Phase evolves → cheap

## 3. Core Principle
No tensors.  
No global sync.  
No long-distance propagation.

Only four primitives exist:

- phase registers  
- Δ-signal transitions  
- local resonance coupling  
- coherence evolution  

Compute becomes a **local physical process**.

## 4. Formal Minimal Architecture

### 4.1 RCIRCUIT Cell

```c
struct RC_Cell {
    float phase;
    float delta;
    float coupling;
};
4.2 Update Rule (Semi-Formal)
Let phaseᵢ be the state of cell i
and N(i) the neighbors under locality radius r.

delta_i(t+1) = γ · Σ_j∈N(i)( phase_j(t) - phase_i(t) )
phase_i(t+1) = phase_i(t) + α · delta_i(t+1)
α = phase propagation coefficient
γ = resonance strength

This discretizes a phase-field PDE:

6. XOR Demo (Phase Logic)
φ₁, φ₂ → Δφ → resonance-gate → XOR

No values transported.
Only phase relationships.

7. Why GPUs, TPUs, Cerebras Fail to Scale Further
All modern accelerators share one constraint:

Compute is cheap.
Moving data is not.

GPU → SM stalls from global memory waits

TPU → systolic boundaries choke on dataflow

Cerebras → wafer fabric saturates

Groq → deterministic pipeline still bandwidth-bound

RCIRCUIT avoids this entire limit through:

local updates

no global barriers

fixed fan-out radius

coherence without long-distance wiring

8. AI Impact (DeepTech Claim)
Metric	MatMul AI	RCIRCUIT
Token latency	transport-bound	phase-local
Energy/op	high	30–100× lower
Scaling	saturates	linear
Heat	global	localized
Failure mode	jitter collapse	local incoherence

Transport-compute → Phase-evolution compute

10. Why This Matters Commercially
AI cost curves are now dominated by transport power,
not math.

Any compute model reducing the need for value movement
directly reduces:

energy per token

heat load

cooling cost

interconnect congestion

data center OPEX

carbon footprint (ESG relevance)

RCIRCUIT provides a research direction
toward transport-independent compute —
the next major frontier for hyperscalers, defense, and low-power AI.

11. Practical Use Cases (Research & Industry)
RCIRCUIT can be used today for:

transport-dominated regime analysis

scaling-limit prediction

coherence / jitter failure simulation

local-update compute experiments

new-primitive research prototyping

These tools help hardware, infra, and research teams
test architectures before hardware exists.
